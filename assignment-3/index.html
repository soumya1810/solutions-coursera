			The preparation of Mughlai cuisine was likely time-consuming and very involved with the number of flavored sauces and butter-based curries—it's almost like it was created to make people want more food because it can be that indulgent! The names of these foods are also so intriguing, which may tempt people to try new dishes in the Mughlai style. our restaurant interpret Mughlai dishes as mild to medium-hot cream and nut-based gravies, rice dishes with lots of nuts, dried fruits, and rich creamy desserts where you should expect spices like saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and nutmeg. These popular Mughlai-style gravies also pair well with rice and bread.

			Common dishes that feature traditional Mughlai flavors include biryani, kebabs, kofta (meatballs), pulao (or pilaf), and tandoor. Examples of these traditional dishes include Mughlai chicken, Mughlai biryani, Mughlai paratha, malai kofta, reshmi kebab, kadhai gosht, and murg tandoor. Traditional Mughlai desserts include the bread pudding shani tukra, barfi, kalakand, and falooda.

			Italian cuisine has a great variety of different ingredients which are commonly used, ranging from fruits, vegetables, sauces, meats, etc. In the North of Italy, fish (such as cod, or baccalà), potatoes, rice, corn (maize), sausages, pork, and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients used here. Pasta dishes with use of tomato are spread in all Italy. we like our ingredients fresh and subtly seasoned and spiced.
			Italian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths, and shapes. Most pastas may be distinguished by the shapes for which they are named—penne, maccheroni, spaghetti, linguine, fusilli, lasagne, and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like ravioli and tortellini.
